# Time Series Analysis of Sunspot Activity

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed time series analysis of **monthly mean sunspot** data, investigating the long-term behavior and periodic nature of solar activity. The analysis includes stationarity testing, autocorrelation analysis, time series decomposition, and cross-correlation analysis with Earth's surface temperature anomalies.

## Project Description

Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sunâ€™s photosphere, and their count can provide valuable insights into solar cycles and their potential impacts on Earthâ€™s climate. This project aims to:
- Analyze sunspot data for temporal trends and seasonal patterns.
- Perform stationarity and autocorrelation analysis to understand underlying dynamics.
- Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- Investigate the relationship between sunspot activity and global temperature anomalies using cross-correlation analysis.

## Dataset

The sunspot data used in this analysis is publicly available and can be accessed from the SILSO (Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations) official database:

## Key Steps and Methods

1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Histogram visualization of sunspot data to evaluate distribution (skewness and kurtosis).
   - Assessment of statistical metrics like mean, variance, and standard deviation.

2. **Stationarity Analysis**:
   - Use of rolling mean and standard deviation.
   - First-order differencing to stabilize the mean and achieve stationarity.

3. **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)**:
   - Computation of autocorrelations at various lags to examine cyclical behavior and seasonal effects.

4. **Time Series Decomposition**:
   - Decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components to isolate underlying patterns.

5. **Cross-Correlation Analysis**:
   - Analysis of correlations between sunspot numbers and global temperature anomalies, as well as atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

## Results

- The sunspot data exhibits clear cyclical trends consistent with the 11-year solar cycle.
- Cross-correlation analysis revealed weak correlations between sunspot activity and temperature anomalies, suggesting other factors, such as atmospheric CO2, may play a larger role in influencing global temperature.
